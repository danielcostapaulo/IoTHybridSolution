This folder contains all of the programming done in Python, namely:
* Analysis of data from every step of this project.
* Train and test of ML algorithms.
* Analysis of results obtained.
* Some minor functions such as cvs manipulation.

The file is made in Jupyter Notebook, and all of the code sections are independent, **exept for the first, which must be executed for the majority of the other sections** since it has many frequently used functions and imports.
